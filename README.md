## <img align="center" width="5%" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Arduino_Logo.svg/720px-Arduino_Logo.svg.png"/> Arduino - Controller System (C++)

<b>Goal:</b> is to make a system on arudino's Crystal Liquid Display that can be controlled using a remote controller to manage Different Sensors and Devices example(fan speed, high temperature sensor detector and alerts, LED's Brightness, RFID Scanners)

<b>Learning Outcomes:</b> being able understand and program each kind of Sensors and Components to integrate with the system

<b>Possible Enhancements:</b> we can extend this project by creating a mobile app for all connected components and be able to control and see stats

<b>Goal:</b> this project for schools and especially for students and parents it aims to track and monitor students progress like(schedule , Agendas, Attendees, Grades) all of the student information is stored on external mysql database and the sensitive informations and cached data is stored on SQLITE in order to prevent many request on the server

<b>Learning Outcomes:</b> installing android studio and the emulator or using WSA for extra challenge , exchanging data between the app and the mysql database using JDBC Driver , Elegance Design using the basics of Android studio XML forms

<b>Possible Enhancements:</b> for this project its best to build an API for key user authentications and data transfer and exchange , also since we are doing mobile app its better to use the notification service to get best outcome by this we can send announcements using the app

<b>Design:</b> <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/Ap7wKtXiTjhhbUiB4O4Sum/School-In?node-id=1-1717&starting-point-node-id=1%3A8185&scaling=contain&authuser=0">Figma Design</a>

## <img align="center" width="5%" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Scratch_S.svg"/> Scratch Highway Escape (Game)

<b>Goal:</b> using scratch is a great and easy way to create little 2d games using a block based programing language the aim is to use the platform with everything it got to implement the logic by creating something that can be playable

<b>Learning Outcomes:</b> applying logic to different sprites , understand the screen axis to control different sprites simultaneously , apply sounds and costumes , track score

<b>Possible Enhancements:</b> we can modify the game to make it work on devices gyroscope sensor so dodging the cars will happen by tilting the screen

<b>Design:</b> <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/552184172/" target="_blank">Game Link</a>

<b>Goal:</b> create a simple Hospital Management System to track doctors,nurses,patients records and duties while creating a simple User Interface Using JavaFx

<b>Learning Outcomes:</b> Learn how to use setup&JavaFx , create the necessary logic Design for the System Using OOP Techniques

<b>Possible Enhancements:</b> we can enhance this software by store data in actual database rather than using arrays only using JDBC or an API for extra challenge

<b>Goal:</b> its a website for network ISP which have a login portal for its users to see their consumption in a beautiful and modern way using charts also they can easily recharge using the portal and the website contains all the necessary information about the plans and their different services

<b>Learning Outcomes:</b> Leverage your Web Skills by creating a challenging web design using the basics of web HTML/CSS for the front end and PHP + MYSQL for backend to get the idea of how most websites works at the bottom before deciding which framework to pick

<b>Possible Enhancements:</b> this website has the lack of responsiveness on screen sizes it would be much better to consider a responsive website

<b>Goal:</b> this is a database design for a Telecom Company to store and track the record of users by implementing a well structured business rule

<b>Learning Outcomes:</b> Setting up Oracle Database With Different Users and roles, create the necessary database, and tables respecting the relationship

<b>Possible Enhancements:</b> you could create a good software or web app on top of this well structured Database Design

<b>Goal:</b> A colorful cli famous game the aim of the project beside its simple concept is to create a cli game with multiplier or single player option the multiplier could be played by 2 or the single mode using AI MIN-MAX Algorithm

<b>Learning Outcomes:</b> Researching and implementing an AI-Algorithm MIN-MAX , Using various system method to make the game colorful and create a UI on the cli with a render phase , understand of dynamic memory allocation, using 2D arrays and Type Structs

<b>Possible Enhancements:</b> ---
